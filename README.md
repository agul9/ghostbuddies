# Ghost Buddies
A Game Boy Advance emulator game built in C, featuring original game art, sprites, and interactive gameplay mechanics.

### My Role
Designed all game art and maps and implemented gameplay mechanics, including animations, collision detection, and screen transitions.

### Tech Stack
C, Gameboy Advance Emulator

## How to Play:
**Level 1:** shoot 10 animals by hitting B to win the level

**Level 2:** all the bats are in the top left corner when the game starts, so avoid the witches and go there to get candy first. Once you have some candy, start shooting the  witches by pressing A till some animals come up, and then it's just like level one - shoot 10 animals to win the level!

**Level 3:** collect all 10 bats to win but make sure to avoid the witches completely - candy to kill them is scattered about the map

**Or just press R to use the cheat that lets you shoot animals and witches at once!**

## Downloading Instructions:

1. Once you've downloaded the files, make sure you have a working GBA emulator
   (ex: the one I used can be downloaded here: https://www.emulatorgames.net/emulators/gameboy-advance/visualboyadvance-m-64-bit-2-0-2/)
2. Copy the exact file path of the emulator next to "command" in the tasks.jason file in the .vscode folder
